    <h2>More details about Python</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python is Interpreted</strong> − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need
            to compile your program
            before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
        <li><strong>Python is Interactive</strong> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the
            interpreter directly to write
            your programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Python is Object-Oriented</strong> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of
            programming that encapsulates code
            within objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Python is a Beginner's Language</strong> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level
            programmers and supports the
            development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
